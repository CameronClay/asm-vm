# Assembler and Virtual machine
This is a two-pass assembler which converts assembly code into byte-code which can then be run on the virtual machine. Based on Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture.
Written in C++.

## Note
The code for this project is private but I am more than happy to show and explain the code.
